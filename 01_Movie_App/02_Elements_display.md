We will learn something amazing `CSS` gifted us with a `display`: 

``````css

display: inline;
display: block;
display: inline-block;
display: none;

``````

Letâ€™s take each one to see what they mean ðŸ¤”

You might not know that you have already seen elements that are by `default` have their `display: block;`

- Headings 
- Paragraphs 
- Lists

And another `default` display that elements might have is `display: inline;` which you will find in: 

- Images 
- Links 

Letâ€™s test it on an empty website:
